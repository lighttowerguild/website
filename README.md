# LTGuild

Light Tower Guild is a non-profit organization whose mission statement and intent is to make internships easier to access! We want to break down some of the traditional barriers that have stopped individuals from being able to obtain an internship to futher their careers. Four year college students should not be the only ones with access to these internships. Also, we focus on non-traditional learning paths and hope to assest people into obtaining a viable internship that simulates a real world working environment. Contact us and let us know if you are in need of a tech internship and come from a non-traditional learning environment. (ex. self taught, boot camp)
